# ROSS (Responsive Opposing rockpaperScissors Servant) Bot

This was our submission for Hack Club Scrapyard (March 1-2, 2025). This includes all the code and pictures to create a rock, paper, scissors robot!

## Materials
- 3 Soda Cans (We used 2 Coke and a Celsius can for the most optimal build)
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- One servo
- Two red LEDs
- One green LED
- Jumper cables
- A bread board
- Three Buttons

## Instructions

### Microcontroller

For this project, we used a [Raspberry Pi Pico 2](#) flashed with [CircuitPython](#). This may work with [MicroPython], however we failed multiple times while using it before switching to (the arguably inferior) circuitpython.
